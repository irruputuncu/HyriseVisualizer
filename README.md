HyriseVisualizer
================

The HyriseVisualizer is a web app, that provides an user interface for analytical 
interactions with the in-memory database prototype HYRISE. It itself is still a prototype
and at the moment only tested to work in Google Chrome.

The HyriseVisualizer uses [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com) as a JavaScript charting library, which can also be
found in the sources of this project. Please note, that Highcharts is not free for [commercial use](http://shop.highsoft.com/faq#what-is-non-commercial).
