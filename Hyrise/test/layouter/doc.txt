Graph File
==========

First line:
  number of vertices | number of edges | type

Example

  7 11 1

* 7 vertices
* 11 edges
* weighted on edges


Data Lines
----------

* pairs of vertice, weight
* i'th line represent the i'th vertex

HYRISE Applicability
====================

* all primary partitions represent a vertice
* acces between partitions represent edges


Output
======

list of lines where each line represent the id for the partition
